# Jekyll admin vs Netlify CMS
Both are very cool Content Management System for your static site. But when you got to choose one it all depends on your needs. Both have their pros and cons. 

## 1. Publish content on the go

Although jekyll admin provides a cool interface to edit page and write markdowns for your post when its about publishing your content Netlify CMS has the edge. It allows the user to login with netlify credentials and you can edit anywhere and publish anytime from your laptop, tablet or even smartphones. However in case of jekyll admin it is suggested to use some other tools like Git GUI or use command line to push your code. 

Netlify even provides a feature of a cool workflow so you can set its status as draft, review or ready. You can change the settings to view the preview of the new site and with that you can visit the new content that you are working on, all online. 

DISCLAIMER: It might take sometime to build and display the edited content.

Looks like with minor tweaks we can view the exact content we are working on. 

## 2. Ease of integration

If you want to edit a site on the go then Netlify CMS is a great option but when it comes to integration, Jekyll admin has the edge. Alll you got to do is list the gem in gemfile and bundle it. You will be all set. Just serve the site locally and goto `/admin` you can start editing you site. Integrating the Netlify CMS is not too difficult. 

## 3. Work Flow management

Both CMS allow the user with the access to the repo to make changes with their interface but there might be different user doing different job like some might be good at writing other at generating the idea and some might be helpful by reviewing for mistakes and improvements. In case of jekyll it's hard to manage the workflow while in netlify cms however it is implemented with ease.  You can chane the state of the content and publish it only after it has gone through the review phase and is ready to be published.
