  ## Intro


  Before you continue with this tutorial it is essential that you visit <https://cdrsagar.netlify.app/faunadb/javascript/js/nextjs/2022/02/27/faunadb-allow-users-with-certain-email-to-edit-documents.html>




  If you do as it is shown in the PART 1 of this tutorial then you will have a working TODO app with authentication already setup. Now we will look into how we can implement an admin feature. Basically we will set certain users with certain email as admin and they will have access to all the data.
